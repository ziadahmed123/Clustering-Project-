# Clustering-Project-
 Any unlabeled dataset can be clustered by the user using fuzzy_C_Means clustering using the
original dimensionality of the dataset and the decreased the same dataset's dimensionality using PCA, then
compare the outcomes before PCA and After PCA.
I did that project on Country Dataset from Kaggel
